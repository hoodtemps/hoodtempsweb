## Vision
*Solve why we lack community, and the rest will take care of itself.*

The vision of Hoodtemps is that, **by solving the issue of why we lack connected, thriving and resilient hyper-local communities**, or 'hoods', we are setting the conditions for new solutions to emerge - directly from within our hoods - for seemingly intractable problems. We also envision that, through **liasons that come from the hood**, built on the trust we have built at the hood level, **Hoodtemps will become the springboard for social initiatives.**


**Critically, however, Hoodtemps has to be something that people look forward to and enjoy. We believe that the resiliency only comes from the shared bond, shared experiences, and a selfish understanding that a strong community is good for everyone, including ourself.**


To expand on our vision:

* By creating resilient hoods, we will allow hoods to take local action and solve their social problems on their own before they require administrative solutions.
    * World hunger -> hood hunger.
    * Integrating immigrants to our nation -> integrating the new family on the street.
    * Youths lack of social engagement -> street hockey and sidewalk chalk.
    * Preventing radicalization - your friends in the hood keeping you grounded.
    * and so on.

* By building social cohesion and trust at the hood level, broader initiatives can more easily build in-roads into various hoods via liasons that come from the hood. If the hood trusts the liason, by proxy they can trust the broader initiative, thus leveraging and building upon trust at the hood level to extend to our broader society.
    * Mass emailing for volunteers -> a liason with a table and a QR code.
    * Mass polling for constituent concerns -> a liason who brings hood concerns to city, state/province, federal level.
    * National campaign to raise awareness -> a liason with a vested interest.

* By providing time to just be together, we expect to build bonds, friendships, memories and traditions. We are trying to set aside time for something that we belive is a basic human need - community.
