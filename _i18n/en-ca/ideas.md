### How to encourage people to self-organize
* Buy some poster board and some markers, so that people can create their own "stations".

### Things to avoid
* **No commercial activity.**
* **No activism for non-Hood issues.**
    * Unless the issue directly affects the Hood **and** there is a direct action that can be taken within your Hood, save it for another time.
