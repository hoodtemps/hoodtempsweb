### The problem
Just as we are **connected technologically** like never before, so are we **disconnected socially** like never before.

### The solution
Time spent together. It is that simple. If we want to feel connected to our community, then we need to set aside for our community to connect. Our community needs time to exist. 

### Your values are how you spend your time

A healthy family requires time spent together.

A healthy organization - be it a business, school or other - requires hours of operation.

Is it any surprise, then, that the entity we give no "hours of operation" to - our community, our **Hood** - is so unhealthy? Is it surprising that we feel so disconnected?

**So let's fix this. Let's make the decision, here and now, that we will set aside time for our hood to exist.**

### OK, how do I start Hoodtemps?

Easy!

1. **Pick a time.**
    - For example, Sunday at 12:00
2. **Spread the word.**
    - Tell your neighbours, your friends, put up a sign, **optionally** <a href="/en-ca/register.html">register</a> your Hoodtemps.
3. **During Hoodtemps, walk out your front door.**
    - Grab some snacks and supplies, then just be. Just be there with your Hood. Do what humans do - chat, play games, tell stories, form bonds.

That is it! Like a seed that is finally given the right conditions to grow, a Hood will emerge where there were once strangers and standoffish neighbours. How do I know? <a href="/en-ca/about.html">It happened to me and my Hood!</a>

Sounds too easy? See <a href="/en-ca/details.html">here</a> for more details.

Sounds interesting? See <a href="/en-ca/vision.html">Hoodtemp's vision</a> for a deeper understanding of the origins of this idea, and where Hoodtemps might go.

Just remember: **nothing is stopping you from doing this completely on your own!**

**The only things that should be discouraged are:**
- **Commercial Activity**
    - No one wants an MLM pitch at a family dinner... the same applies to Hoodtemps.
- **Activism that is beyond the scope of the hood**
    - Build solutions and solve problems for your hood. Hoodtemps is the time to help your elderly neighbour, not solve world affairs.
- **Intolerance**
    - There should be no tolerance for intolerance.
**Be there, so that the Hood can be.**

What Hoodtemps should **not** be:
* A time for commercial activity.
    * Just like you don't want to be pressured into a sales pitch at a family dinner, Hoodtemps is not the time for this.
* Approaching people to raise money or awareness, especially outside the scope of the Hood.
    * Build relationships with your Hood, and then use that relationship outside of Hoodtemps for this.
    * Feel free to setup a table with a sign for people who may be interested, b

_**Note**_: We say **should** not be, because ultimately the members of the Hoodtemps self-organize however they see fit, however we want this time to be seen as similar to family time: **if it outside the scope of the Hood, save it for another time.**

### Ideas

1. Self-organizing Block Party
    Food, drinks, kids playing games, and conversation.
2. 
We assume most Hoodtemps will start off as a self-organizing block party.
_**The ingredients of a resilient and thriving community already exist in its people, the one missing ingredient is time.**_


### Any member can create a "third space" within Hoodtemps.
There is no organizational body telling you what to do. You can do nothing but sit outside and watch what is going on, or you can organize a 3-on-3 hockey tournament. It is up to you!
