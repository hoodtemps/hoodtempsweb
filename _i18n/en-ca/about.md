Hi, my name is Ryan Hamel, and I am the founder of Hoodtemps.

### The first half of the story
I am an American who moved with his family to Montreal in 2021. When we arrived here as new immigrants, one of the things that made our life here so much richer was a close-knit community that formed during Covid, that we were lucky enough to be a part of. Before Covid, many of these neighbours were essentially strangers, yet they had lived near each other for, in many cases, over a decade. During Covid, however, these neighbours often found themselves out on their porches at the same time, letting their kids get some energy out while isolating. Waves and head nods turned into conversation, converations turned into a shared drink or two, and before long every Friday night became a gathering where bedtimes no longer seemed to exist.

**It was as if the ingredients for an amazing community already existed, but there was just one missing ingredient - time. Time to be together, so together something could grow.**

Where there were strangers, now there are emergency contacts, camping trips, brunches, birthday parties. All of our lives are better individually because of what we formed together.

### The other half of the story
There are two things to know about me: I care deeply about understanding social problems in this world, and I am also a problem solver. Often, those two things mix together to give me nothing more than anxiety — unfortunately - given how intractable these problems seem. However, one technique that I have always used for more technical problems is to **break down an intractable problem into smaller and smaller problems** until I can finally find one that even I can solve. 

**Sometimes, solving that smallest problem can unlock a solution to solving the broader problem.**

So this other half of the story was, quite literally, how I would solve world hunger. Crazy, such hubris, I know. However, I kept breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces. I thought: I can't solve world hunger or even hunger in my own city - even these amazing organizations in my own arrondissement have not yet solved it at that level. So what is left? Well, what if I could solve it on just my street?

So now instead of solving "world hunger," how about "street hunger"? Now that is a problem that no longer seems intractable! Additionally, if you could solve it on one street, could you not solve it on the next? Then all of the streets in NDG, to all of the arrondissements in Montreal, to... you see where this is going. 

So what is the one thing preventing me from solving "street hunger"? **A connected, thriving, and resilient hyper-local community.** OK, I just need to break down this problem one more time - instead of solving street hunger, how do I create a **connected, thriving, and resilient hyper-local community** out of strangers? Finally, as you can figure out from the first half of this story, I have found something even I can solve!

_**Note**_: **Hoodtemps is not about solving world hunger**, but instead it aims to solve this problem of having **connected, thriving, and resilient hyper-local communities**. That is an excellent goal in itself, but I also believe that any solution to solving large-scale social issues will require these types of communities.

Back to problem solving: breaking this problem down one more time.

So why do we not have **connected, thriving, and resilient hyper-local communities**? Simple: because we do not have any time dedicated to letting them exist. Our neighbourhoods are like an unwatered garden - we are missing one simple ingredient: time.

We, as a society, allocate time — legally or just by social convention — for the following:

### Personal time.
What you do with your personal time is up to you, but it is a time for you to take care of your needs and wants.

### Family time.
What your family does is up to your family, but it is a time for your family to take care of your family's needs and wants.

### Hours of operation for organizations.
When an organization—private or public, profit or non-profit—works together to solve whatever the mission of that organization is.

### A new time: Hoodtemps
Thus, the idea of Hoodtemps was born. We just need a **new time**, set aside **each week**, where we can exist as a hyper-local community—or **Hood**.

_The ingredients for a thriving, resilient community already exists within the people, the one last thing we are missing is time._

**When we are us.**
