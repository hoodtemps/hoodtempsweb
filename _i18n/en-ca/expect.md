Hoodtemps can be nothing more than **neighbours milling about, chatting, "killing time"** on their lawns to a **block party** with self-organized stations, games, and activities. Just as "family time" is different with each family, where some families have organized game nights and others just tell stories and laugh, hoodtemps is different with each Hood.

**No one is in charge.** This is just a time for everyone to be together, so that **out of a collection of strangers, a Hood can emerge.** Think of it like family time, but for the Hood.

**Have an open mind, and a willingness to be a part of your Hood.** That is all that is asked of any individual. Just because another individual organizes something more involved during hoodtemps does not mean any member is required to participate, they just need to be around their fellow hoodies.

**Completely apolitical and secular.**

All are welcome, but this is a time to meet your fellow hoodies where they are at, in the here and now.

P.S. It never hurts to bring some **snacks and drinks**.

# Is that really all there is to it?
**Yes.**

It is a **simple idea** with **high impact**: spend more time together as a Hood, and a Hood will form - a hyper-local, connected, resilient community.
