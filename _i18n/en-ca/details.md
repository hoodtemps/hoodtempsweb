<!-- # The "Vibe" of Hoodtemps -->
It is essential that all Hoodtemps 'founders' understand the vibe that Hoodtemps is aiming for.

### Self-organized.

No one needs to be in charge, nothing needs to be planned. Just be together at the same time.

### Hood focused.

Family time is for family, personal time is for self, and the same with work/school time.

**Hoodtemps is for the Hood**.

### Welcoming, inclusive, but non-committal.

Anyone can participate **or choose not** to participate in any aspect. Allow people to create their own **"third places"** for others to choose to join.

### A third space, and a third time.

Outside of home, and work/school, the Hood is now one of your "third places", a term you may have heard. We here at Hoodtemps also emphasize a **"third time"**, where you are **something besides the version of you at home or work**.

When you are a hoodie, who are you?

### Fun!
**If Hoodtemps becomes a chore, it will die.**

If Hoodtemps accomplishes nothing else, having fun with our neighbours on a regular basis seems worth the effort. More importantly, having fun with your neighbours is something you will keep doing!

# Sounds good? Let's Go!

## Your First Hoodtemps
### Pick a time!
Fidn a time where most people are free. For example, Sunday afternoon.
**optionally** [Register your Hoodtemps](/register.html)
### Start Small!
Start with something as simple as just eating snacks and drinks on your front steps at the same time.
    An easy, cheap, and fun idea is to buy some **sidewalk chalk** and hand out **ribbons/prizes** in a competition.
    [We have a list of ideas](/ideas.html) as well for your next Hoodtemps.

### Spread the word!
And also the "vibe" of Hoodtemps!

### Spend time with your Hood!
Lastly, remember: No one is in charge, **not even you.** Just because you picked the first Hoodtemps, does not mean you own it.

**Hoodtemps is for the Hood.**
